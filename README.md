# Automated COVID-19 Screening Framework using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Chest X-rays

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the critical role of early diagnosis using chest X-rays. However, manually distinguishing COVID-19 infections from chest X-ray images presents significant challenges. These challenges arise due to time constraints, the expertise required by radiologists, and the subtle differences between positive and negative X-ray images.

To address these challenges, we introduce an **automated COVID-19 screening framework** that leverages artificial intelligence techniques, combined with a transfer learning approach, to diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

## Key Features
- **Transfer Learning:** Utilized for efficient feature extraction, reducing the need for extensive training on large datasets.
- **Modified Deep Neural Networks:** Tailored neural network architectures to better process and interpret X-ray images.
- **Grad-CAM Visualization:** Employed to visually support and validate the predicted diagnoses, offering insight into areas of interest within the images.

## Results
Our experiments on publicly available datasets reveal that our convolutional neural network model, while being straightforward, outperforms other deep learning techniques across various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.
